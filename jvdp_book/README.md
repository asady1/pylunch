This directory stores content for the PyLunch sessions on the "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas.

The physical (or e-)book is available [from O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) or your favorite bookseller.  However, all the content for the book is also available on [its github repository](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook).  So there is no need to purchase the book unless you prefer it in that format.

Note that the repository for the book is also included here as a git submodule.  If you have cloned this  repository (for PyLunch) in git, the following commands should pull down the book's contents as well:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
