Subject: Pylunch Nova (Python tutorial/knowledge sharing sessions), starting May 17 @ 1pm

Hello all,

Some of you may recall the survey we sent a month or so back about learning/improving skills with Python.  We received 95 responses expressing interest in this idea so we have decided to go forward with this.  So here we're inviting all who are interested to join the first meeting of "Pylunch Nova"*.

To sum up, the intent of Pylunch Nova is to create a peer learning environment where all can improve on using Python effectively for science.  The material will be geared to science staff/postdocs, but all who are doing research will likely get something out of it.  The general format will be for the day's leaders (initially the two of us) to present some introductory material, and then most of the session will be spent on having the participants actually work on tutorials and the like, and be able to ask questions of the leaders or anyone else in the room.  So be sure to bring your laptops!

The first session will be Tuesday, May 17, 1-2pm in the Boardroom (4th floor of Muller).  We will plan to hold sessions at 1pm every other Tuesday  We have mapped out a tentative schedule which you can examine in more detail [here](https://github.com/spacetelescope/pylunch/blob/master/roadmap.md).  The first two sessions will be introductory sessions about Python and the Astronomy ecosystem in Python.  While this might be basic for some starting with more Python background, we encourage you to come regardless, as a large goal of these sessions is knowledge *sharing* between everyone.

Our tentative plan also includes a "Hack Hour" every third session.  This will be an open day with no formal content, but all interested can come for the session to work on Python-related tasks you might have with other Python expertise in the room.

We will also have a mailing list for this group - the pre-exiting "pylunch" mailing list seems great for this purpose, so you can add yourself to that (it's one of the Exchange groups), or if you're not sure how to do that, just fill out the form at http://bit.ly/stsci-pylunch-signup and we'll get you added.

We hope this will provide a great venue for STScI scientists to gain Python skills in a collegial and low-time-committment environment, and hope to see many of you there!
