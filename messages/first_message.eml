Subject: Pylunch Nova (Python tutorial/knowledge sharing sessions), starting May 17 @ 1pm

Hello all,

Some of you may recall the survey we sent you a few weeks ago about learning/improving skills with Python.  We received 95 responses expressing interest in this idea so we have decided to go forward with this.  Hence, here we're letting you all know about our tentative plan for "Pylunch Nova"*. To sum up, it is <short description that makes it clear this is aimed at helping *scistaff* learn but still being inclusive for those that want to trade knowledge.>

The first session will be Thursday, May 17, 1-2pm in LOCATION.  We will plan to hold sessions at 1pm every other Thursday. We have mapped out a tentative schedule which you can examine in more detail [here](https://github.com/spacetelescope/pylunch/blob/master/roadmap.md).  The first two sessions will be introductory sessions about Python and the Astronomy ecosystem in Python.  While this might be basic for some starting with more Python background, we encourage you to come regardless, as a large goal of these sessions is knowledge *sharing* between everyone, not just the organizers presenting materials.

Our tentative plan also includes a "Hack Hour" every third session.  This will be an open day with no formal content, but all interested can join simply come for the session to work on Python-related tasks you might have with other Python expertise in the room.

<details about the mailing list>

We hope this will provide a great venue for STScI scientists to gain Python skills in a collegial and low-time-committment environment, and hope to see many of you there!
