PyLunch Nova <sup>*</sup>
-------------------------

Every other Tuesday at 1pm 

Stores tutorials, code, discussion for STScI PyLunch.  You can look at "prettified" versions of the presentations at http://spacetelescope.github.io/pylunch.

<sup>*</sup> This is both a "new" version of PyLunch, and PyLunch is a recurring astronomical phenomenon.
